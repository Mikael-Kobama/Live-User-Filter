# Live User Filter

This project allows users to search through a list of randomly generated users by their name and location. The data is fetched from the [RandomUser.me API](https://randomuser.me/), and the user interface provides a simple way to search and filter the results dynamically. Additionally, there's a dark/light mode toggle for a better user experience.

## Features

- **Search by name and/or location**: Users can filter the list of generated users based on name and location.
- **Dynamic data loading**: The app fetches 50 random users from the RandomUser API and displays them.
- **Responsive user interface**: The layout is designed to work well across different screen sizes.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: A toggle allows users to switch between dark and light modes for the appâ€™s interface.

## Technologies Used
